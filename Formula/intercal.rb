  # The latest version tags in the Git repository are `0.31` (2019-06-12) and
  # `0.30` (2015-04-02) but there are older versions like `1.27` (2010-08-25)
  # and `1.26` (2010-08-25). These two older 1.x releases are wrongly treated
  # as newer but the GitLab project doesn't do releases, so we can only
  # reference the tags. We work around this by restricting matching to 0.x
  # releases for now. If the major version reaches 1.x in the future, this
  # check will also need to be updated.
